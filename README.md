# Potential Customers Prediction

This project aims to predict potential customers for a given business using machine learning techniques. The dataset is processed to identify patterns and predict which customers are likely to make a purchase.

## Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that helps a business target potential customers effectively. By analyzing customer data, the model predicts which individuals are most likely to convert.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as customer demographics, purchase history, and online activity. It has been cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Wrangling)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Random Forest
- DecisionTree
- LogisticRegression
- GridSearchCV


## Results:
The predictive model achieved a high accuracy in identifying potential customers, making it a valuable tool for targeted marketing campaigns. Key performance metrics include:

- Accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 80%
- Recall: 78%
